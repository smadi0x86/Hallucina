# Development Guide â€” Hallucina

# Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and enhancements for Hallucina to achieve its goal of confusing and hallucinating LLM clients used with custom MCP servers for disassemblers like Ghidra and IDA PRO.

---

## Planned Features

### 1. Python Wrapper

We plan to develop a Python-based CLI wrapper to simplify the usage of Hallucina. The wrapper will:

- Provide an intuitive interface for configuring obfuscation options.
- Automate the integration of Hallucina into build systems.
- Support batch processing of multiple files or projects.
- Include detailed logging and error reporting for better user feedback.

#### Example Commands:

- Obfuscating a single file:
  ```
  hallucina-cli obfuscate --input test.c --output test_obfuscated.c --flags "indirect-jumps,string-encryption"
  ```
- Obfuscating an entire project:
  ```
  hallucina-cli obfuscate-project --build-dir ./build --flags "control-flow-flattening,opaque-predicates"
  ```

### 2. Advanced Obfuscation Techniques

To further enhance the effectiveness of Hallucina, we plan to implement the following advanced techniques:

- **Dynamic Code Transformation**: Introduce runtime code transformations to make static analysis nearly impossible.
- **Anti-Debugging Mechanisms**: Embed anti-debugging techniques to detect and disrupt reverse engineering attempts.
- **Code Virtualization**: Convert critical code sections into a custom virtual machine bytecode to obscure logic.
- **LLM-Specific Confusion**: Add patterns and transformations specifically designed to confuse LLM-based analysis tools.

### 3. Integration with Disassembler Plugins

Develop plugins for popular disassemblers like Ghidra and IDA PRO to:

- Automatically apply Hallucina obfuscation during the build process.
- Provide real-time feedback on obfuscation effectiveness.

---

### 4. Enhanced Binary-Level Post-Processing

Expand binary-level transformations to include:

- **Instruction Substitution**: Replace common instructions with equivalent but less recognizable alternatives.
- **Metadata Obfuscation**: Obfuscate debugging symbols and metadata to hinder automated analysis.
- **Control Flow Graph (CFG) Manipulation**: Introduce fake control flow paths to mislead analysis tools.

---

### 5. Comprehensive Testing Framework

Develop a robust testing framework to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of Hallucina:

- Unit tests for individual obfuscation techniques.
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows.
- Performance benchmarks to measure the impact of obfuscation on runtime and binary size.
